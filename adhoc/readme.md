# adhoc
This folder contains a lot of ad-hoc scripts or examples of running cmdlets from the 'azure.datafactory.tools' module.
These files are not part of the module and are being used for internal dev purposes as helpers.
They might NOT work on your local machine - feel free to change path(s) or other variables hardcoded.

Thanks,
Kamil
